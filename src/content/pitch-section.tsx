            Traditional meme coins have teams that reserve tokens for liquidity mining and rewards, but $WELSH is built differently. $WELSH is community-owned meme coin with 100% of tokens in circulation. There is no team, no more emissions, no reserve fund for liquidity rewards. This creates a challenge: how to incentivize holders to provide liquidity?

            Community meme coins on Bitcoin are built different.  There is no team, there are no VCs and there are no DAOs.  But being community-driven has it's draw backs.  There is no treasury and with all the $ELSh tokens in circulation, there are no more emissions. Therefore it's difficult to fund liquidity programs to incentivize liquidity providers.  This is where Welsh Street comes in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Without more $WELSH being minted and entering circulation and no way to change the supply, it's time to get innovative.

            The solution is to take it to the $STREET — the rewards token that helps solve the liquidity incentive puzzle of fixed-supply community memes. When you provide liquidity to the $WELSH / $STREET pool, you receive $STREET rewards that you can swap for more $WELSH and provide more liquidity. It's a flywheel to keep the $WELSH economy growing and flowing.
        </p>
        <p>
           The $WELSH / $STREET liquidity token is called $CREDIT.  Yes, you read that right. Street $CREDIT entitles users to earn more $STREET rewards. $STREET is emitted directly into the rewards pool, creating a powerful incentive for liquidity providers to keep providing liquidity. $CREDIT holder and $CREDIT holders only can claim the $STREET rewards. No lock-ups, no complicated staking mechanisms, no withdrawing liquidity to claim — just pure emission rewards injected in to the rewards pool every bitcoin block. Tick, tock.
        </p>    
        <p>
             But it gets better than that. In addition to emission rewards, Street $CREDIT entitles you to claim $WELSH and $STREET fees from trading activity on the Welsh Street Exchange. The more users trade, the more you earn.
