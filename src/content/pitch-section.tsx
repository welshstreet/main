            Traditional meme coins have teams that reserve tokens for liquidity mining and rewards, but WELSH is built differently. WELSH is a community-owned meme coin with 100% of tokens in circulation. There are no teams, no VCs, no DAOs, no more emissions, and no reserve fund for liquidity rewards. This makes WELSH unruggable and truly community-driven. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Being community-driven has its drawbacks — it's difficult to fund liquidity programs to incentivize liquidity providers. Without more WELSH being minted and entering circulation and no way to change the supply, it's time to get innovative.
        </p>
        <p>  
            This is where Welsh Street comes in.
        </p>
        <p>
            The solution to liquidity rewards on a community coin is to take it to the STREET — the rewards token that helps solve the liquidity incentive paradox of fixed-supply community coin. STREET is emitted directly into the rewards pool. The only users who can claim STREET rewards are WELSH / STREET liquidity providers. 
        </p>
            The WELSH / STREET liquidity token is called CREDIT. When you provide liquidity to the WELSH / STREET pool, you receive CREDIT LP tokens that entitle you to claim STREET rewards. 
        <p>
            CREDIT holders and CREDIT holders only can claim the STREET rewards. No lock-ups, no complicated staking mechanisms, no withdrawing liquidity to claim — just pure emission rewards injected into the rewards pool every bitcoin block. Tick, tock. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            STREET rewards can be swapped for more WELSH to provide more liquidity. It's a flywheel that keeps the WELSH economy growing and flowing. But it gets better than that. In addition to emission rewards, CREDIT entitles you to claim WELSH and STREET fees from trading activity on the Welsh Street Exchange. The more users trade, the more you earn.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Street Credit rewards mechanism creates a powerful incentive for liquidity providers to keep providing liquidity and keep claiming rewards.
