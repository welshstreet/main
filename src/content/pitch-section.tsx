            Traditional meme coins have teams that reserve tokens for liquidity mining and rewards, but $WELSH is built differently. $WELSH is a community-owned meme coin on Bitcoin with 100% of tokens in circulation. There are no teams, no VCs, no DAOs, no more emissions, and no reserve fund for liquidity rewards. Being community-driven has its drawbacks — it's difficult to fund liquidity programs to incentivize liquidity providers. This is where Welsh Street comes in with a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Without more $WELSH being minted and entering circulation and no way to change the supply, it's time to get innovative.

        <p>
            The solution is to take it to the $STREET — the rewards token that helps solve the liquidity incentive puzzle of fixed-supply community memes. The $WELSH / $STREET liquidity token is called $CREDIT. When you provide liquidity to the $WELSH / $STREET pool, you receive $CREDIT LP tokens that entitle you to claim $STREET rewards. $STREET is emitted directly into the rewards pool, creating a powerful incentive for liquidity providers to keep providing liquidity. 
        </p>
        <p>
            $CREDIT holders and $CREDIT holders only can claim the $STREET rewards. No lock-ups, no complicated staking mechanisms, no withdrawing liquidity to claim — just pure emission rewards injected into the rewards pool every bitcoin block. Tick, tock. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            These $STREET rewards can be swapped for more $WELSH to provide more liquidity. It's a flywheel to keep the $WELSH economy growing and flowing. But it gets better than that. In addition to emission rewards, Street $CREDIT entitles you to claim $WELSH and $STREET fees from trading activity on the Welsh Street Exchange. The more users trade, the more you earn.
